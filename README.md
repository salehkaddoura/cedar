# Cedar | Frontend Tech Challenge

Hello Cedar Eng Team,

My Name is Saleh Kaddoura and this is my submission of the Cedar Front end tech challenge.

You can view the app hosted publicly here https://cedar-ad46f.web.app/

- To view the Payment Flow locally please clone the repo and then run `npm install` 
- `npm run dev` will launch the app locally on `http://localhost:5173/`
- To run test please use the `npm run test` command

One thing to note, I did not have any time to mock out any backend API calls. If I did have some more time
I would have added some JSON responses and returned them to my components and passed them down appropriatley.
